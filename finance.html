            <h5>What Is a Stock or Share?</h5>

                    When you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of the company. When a company needs to raise money, it issues shares. This is done through an initial public offering (IPO), in which the price of shares is set based how much the company is estimated to be worth, and how many shares are being issued. The company gets to keep the money raised to grow its business, while the shares (also called stocks) continue to trade on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traders and investors continue to buy and sell the stock of the company on the exchange, although the company itself no longer receives any money from this type of trading. The company only receives money from the IPO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stocks are issued by companies to raise cash, and the stock then continues to trade on an exchange. Overall stocks have risen over the long-term, which makes owning shares attractive. There are also additional perks such as dividends (income), profit potential and voting rights. Share prices also fall, though, which is why investors typically choose to invest in a wide array of stocks, only risking a small percentage of their capital on each one. Shares can be bought or sold at any time, assuming there is enough volume available to complete the transaction, which means investors can cut losses or take profits whenever they wish.

        <h3>Bonds</h3>

                <p>
                    The interest rate, also called the coupon, is typically higher with long-term bonds. These interest payments are usually doled out semiannually, but they can also be sent out annually, quarterly or even monthly. When the bond reaches the date of maturity, the issuer repays the principle, or original amount of the loan.
                </p>
        
            <h5>What Are Bonds?</h5>
                <p>
                    A bond is a debt security, similar to an IOU. Borrowers issue bonds to raise money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.
                    When you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when it "matures," or comes due after a set period of time.

        <h3>401k</h3>
            <h5>What is a 401k plan and how does it work?</h5>
                <p>
                    A 401k is a qualified retirement plan that allows eligible employees of a company to save and invest for their own retirement on a tax deferred basis. Only an employer is allowed to sponsor a 401k for their employees. ... These contributions are deducted from your salary on a pre-tax basis.
                </p>
        <h3>IRA</h3>
            <h5>What is an IRA</h5>
                <p>
                    A Traditional IRA is a retirement account that allows an individual (the “I” in IRA) to set aside tax-deferred income for retirement. The entire contribution and earnings on those contributions are taxed at normal income tax rates when they are withdrawn during retirement.
                </p>
            <h5>Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA</h5>
                <p>
                    Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible on both state and federal tax returns for the year you make the contribution; withdrawals in retirement are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Roth IRAs provide no tax break for contributions, but earnings and withdrawals are generally tax-free.
                </p>
