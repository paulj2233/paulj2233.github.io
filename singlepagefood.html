            <p>
                According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for cucumber and gherkin production in 2013, China produced 76% of the global output, followed by Turkey, Iran, Russia and Ukraine
                
                During 18th century, expansion of cucumbers across North America suddenly stopped when several medicinal journals started reporting that cucumbers and all similar vegetables that were not cooked represented serious health risk. Discouraged by those misconceptions, cucumber use plummeted across the continent, which was reversed only in 19th century
                
                "A Cucumber should be well sliced, and dressed with pepper and vinegar, and then thrown out, as good for nothing."
—Samuel Johnson
