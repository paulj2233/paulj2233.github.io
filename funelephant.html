            <p> Elephants are the largest land animals in the world.</p>

            <p>• The largest elephant on record was an adult male African elephant. It weighed about 24,000 pounds and was 13 feet tall at the shoulder!</p>

            <p>• Elephants can live to be over 70 years old.</p>

            <p>• Only one mammal can’t jump — the elephant.</p>

            <p>• The average weight for an elephant heart is about 27 to 46 pounds!</p>

            <p>• Elephants have a highly    developed brain and the largest of all the land mammals. The brain is 3 or 4 times larger than that of humans although smaller as a proportion of body weight.</p>

            <p>• Elephants have a slow pulse rate of 27. For a canary it is 1000!</p>

            <p>• An elephant’s skin is an inch thick</p>

        <h2>Elephant physical characterestics</h2>
        
        <img src="http://www.visiontimes.com/uploads/2015/07/Elephant-Painting-FI.png"/>
        
            <p>African elephants are the largest of all land animals, adult males weighing between 1,800 and 6,300 kg (2 and 7 tons/ 4,000 and 14,000 lb.). Females are smaller, weighing between 2,700 and 3,600 kg (3 and 4 tons/ 6,000 and 8,000 lb.). Shoulder height ranges between three and four m (9.8 and 13.1 ft.).</p> 
        
            <p>Adult male Asian elephants weigh between 1,800 and 4,500 kg (2 and 5 tons/ 4,000 and 10,000 lb.), with females weighing slightly less. Shoulder height ranges between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft.).</p> 
        
            <p>Elephants use their ears to funnel in sound waves from the environment, contributing to their keen sense of hearing.</p> 
        
            <p>The elephant's trunk is an extension of the upper lip and nose. It functions for grasping, breathing, feeding, dusting, smelling, drinking, lifting, sound production/communication, defense/protection, and sensing.</p>

            <p>The trunk contains an estimated 100,000 muscles and tendons in the trunk, giving it extreme flexibility and strength. Elephant trunks are capable of expanding, contracting, and moving in a diverse array of directions.</p>

            <p>An adult Asian elephant can hold up to 8.5 L (2.2 gal.) of water in its trunk. Water is sprayed into the mouth for drinking and onto the back to keep cool.</p>

            <p>Elephants' trunks and keen sense of smell are used to survey the environment. The trunk is raised and waived in the air to gather scent particles. Through the trunk, the scent particles are then carried to a specialized gland called the Jacobson's organ, located in the roof of the mouth. The Jacobson's organ is able to gather information about the elephant's surroundings by detecting and analyzing molecules and particles from the air. Through this process, elephants are capable of locating water sources up to 19.2 km (12 mi.) away and can even determine the reproductive status of distant elephants.</p>

            <p>Elephants can reach vegetation as high as 57 m (19 ft.) by rearing up onto their hind legs and extending their trunk.</p>
        
            <p>Elephant trunks are very powerful-capable of uprooting an entire tree trunk, tearing down heavy branches, and delivering a forceful blow in self-defense.    </p>

        <h2>Elephant behavior</h2>

            <p>Elephants form deep family bonds and live in tight matriarchal family groups of related females called a herd. The herd is led by the oldest and often largest female in the herd, called a matriarch. Herds consist of 8-100 individuals depending on terrain and family size. When a calf is born, it is raised and protected by the whole matriarchal herd. Males leave the family unit between the ages of 12-15 and may lead solitary lives or live temporarily with other males.</p>


            <p>Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have memories that span many years. It is this memory that serves matriarchs well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds, sometimes for tens of miles, to watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger and play.</p>


            <p>Recent discoveries have shown that elephants can communicate over long distances by producing a sub-sonic rumble that can travel over the ground faster than sound through air. Other elephants receive the messages through the sensitive skin on their feet and trunks. It is believed that this is how potential mates and social groups communicate.</p>

        <h2>Elephant habitat</h2>

            <p>Elephants live in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are found most often in savannas, grasslands, and forests, but they also live in deserts, swamps, and mountains.</p>
        
            <p>The African elephant's other role is to pull down trees and break up thorny bushes. As a result, they create grasslands and salt licks in order to make other animals' lives easier to survive in their environment. Their final role is that they create water holes by digging in dry river beds.</p>

        <h2>Why important</h2>
        
            <p>African elephants are slow breeders, with an interbirth interval of 2.5-9 (usually 5) years. Life expectancy is about 50-70 years. Elephants play an important role in the ecosystem they inhabit. They modify their habitat by converting areas of forest to grassland, and are important seed dispersers.</p>
        
       <p>There are a couple of main reasons why elephants are endangered – illegal killing of them and the destruction of their habitat. Most elephants are illegally killed to take their ivory tusks. They are sold for an unbelievable amount of money which makes engaging in that activity so enticing.
        </p>
        
        <p>Ivory poaching for tusks is the main reason that elephants have been so heavily hunted. Elephant ivory has been used in huge amounts to make billiards balls, piano keys, identification chops and many other items for human enjoyment.</p>
